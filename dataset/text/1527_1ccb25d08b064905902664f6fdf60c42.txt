When a passenger arrives at the security screening belt, the process begins. The first step is to check if the passenger has any hand luggage with them. If there is no hand luggage, the passenger can proceed through the walkthrough metal detector. Once the passenger completes the screening, the process is finished.
If the passenger does have hand luggage, they are required to put it in a tray. The passenger then places the tray on the belt. At this point, two events can occur simultaneously. First, the passenger sends a message to the airport indicating that their belongings are ready for screening. Second, the airport starts observing the hand luggage in the X-Ray machine and the walkthrough metal detector.
The airport observes the hand luggage in the X-Ray machine to ensure there are no prohibited items. Simultaneously, the airport observes the hand luggage in the walkthrough metal detector to check for any metal objects.
Once both observations are complete, the airport transmits the screening data to the authorities. This step ensures that the necessary security checks are performed. Finally, when the screening process is finished, the airport confirms that the screening is completed, and the passenger can proceed with their journey.
