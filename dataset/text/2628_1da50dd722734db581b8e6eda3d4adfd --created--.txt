This is the process of a customer purchasing a pizza. The customer first selects the pizza they want to eat and places an order. When the delivery staff receives the order, they process the payment. The customer makes the payment. If the payment fails, the delivery staff puts the order on hold. If the payment error cannot be resolved, the delivery staff terminates the service. Otherwise, they update the order and pass it along. If the payment is successful, they pass the order on. After that, the pizza chef makes the pizza and hands it over to the delivery boy. The customer then receives the pizza and can enjoy it. At this point, the order is considered finished.
