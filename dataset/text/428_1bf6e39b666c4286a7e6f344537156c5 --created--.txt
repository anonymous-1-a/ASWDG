This is the BPM adoption phase, specifically the iterative process improvement phase.
First, there are initial process models and descriptions available. The adoption coordinator and process analysts then proceed to modify the process descriptions and models based on their analysis.
The organization's sponsor and management then evaluate the modifications that have been made.
If the changes are not approved, the adoption coordinator and process analysts will modify the process description and models once again. However, if the changes are approved, the process models and descriptions will be updated accordingly. The adoption coordinator and process analysts will then publish the modified models to the Process Collaborative Environment (PCE). Meanwhile, the updated processes will be implemented in the process-based Enterprise Information System (EIS).
Once the two tasks are completed, the adoption coordinator and process analysts will monitor the execution of the process and analyze the resulting process data. The organization's management and sponsor will then evaluate the monitoring results and subsequently request any necessary improvements. The adoption coordinator and process analysts will continue to modify the model.
It's important to note that the process does not end permanently. Instead, it continues in a cycle of continuous modification, monitoring, and evaluation.
