If the hardware retailer has goods to ship, the shipping process will begin. The warehouse worker is responsible for packaging the goods. At the same time, the clerk will decide whether to use normal post or arrange for a special shipment. If a special shipment is required, which includes insurance provided by the carrier service, the clerk will first request quotes from carriers. Then, the clerk will assign a carrier and prepare the necessary paperwork for the shipment. If the decision is to use normal post, the clerk will check if extra insurance is necessary. Regardless of whether extra insurance is needed or not, the clerk will always fill in a post label for the shipment. However, if it is determined that extra insurance is required, the logistics manager will take care of obtaining the additional insurance. Once the clerk and warehouse worker have completed their respective tasks, the warehouse worker will add the necessary paperwork to the package. They will then move the package to the designated pick-up area. Finally, the goods will be made available for pick-up.
