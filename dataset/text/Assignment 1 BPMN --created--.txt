The process of report production starts with the researcher creating the report blueprint. After he creates the report blueprint, job details are created for the employees in the field of data specialization. Employees in the field of data specialization include data extractors and data analysts. For the data extractor, they need to prepare the article search string, create the data extraction template, and store the extracted template in the Extraction DB. Meanwhile, data analysts need to build statistical models and store them in Model DB. After that, the researcher assigns tasks to employees in the field of data profession. The data extractor and data analyst need to work together.
Data extractor: a. Use the search string to collect resources from Extraction DB. b. Extract useful data from the resources. c. Upload the extracted results to the validating system. d. System review and approval of extraction results. e. Upload the data, and if the upload passes, generate a success message and store the extracted data in Extraction DB. If it fails, generate an error log and then correct the extraction process based on the feedback from the system. After the correction, continue to upload the extracted results to the validation system.
Data analyst: a. Retrieve statistical models from Model DB and convert them into executable programs. b. Wait until the extracted data is ready.
When the extracted data is ready, the analyst enters the raw data retrieved from Extraction DB into the program and then tests the model. If the test model fails, the analyst has to modify the program, and if the test model succeeds, the analyst needs to create a model diagnostic report and store it in the Model DB. The researcher retrieves model diagnostic reports from Model DB, finalizes the model, and evaluates the model. Eventually, the report will be completed.
