The procurement department of Renson has made a decision regarding the type of order. If it is a purchase order, they will retrieve it from the EPR system and also from the supply chain department of Renson. If it is an external treatment order, they will retrieve it from the EPR System and again from the Supply Chain Department of Renson.
After retrieving the order, the procurement department of Renson will determine if a fixed external contact should be established. If the answer is yes, they will proceed to determine the order hierarchy based on quota status. After determining the order hierarchy based on the quota status, the next step is to negotiate the price. If the negotiation has not taken place yet, the procurement department of Renson will proceed to negotiate the price directly with the supplier. In this case, the supplier will send a price tender to the Procurement Department of Renson, and in response, the department will send a counter proposal to the supplier. If the price negotiation has already been completed, the next consideration is whether an automated ordering procedure with the supplier is possible. If it is feasible, the Procurement Department of Renson will create a parameter file for the automated ordering process. On the other hand, if an automated ordering procedure is not possible, the department will create a tender and then send the order to the supplier.
If no fixed external contact is required, they will contact the appropriate external contact to inquire about feasibility and gather supplier feedback. Following that, they will engage in price negotiations. The supplier will send a price tender to the Procurement Department of Renson, and in return, the department will send a counter proposal to the supplier. After negotiating the price, the procurement department of Renson will create a tender and proceed to send the order to the supplier.
Regardless of the specific situation, once the order has been sent to the supplier, the department will process the order confirmation received from the supplier. Following that, they will check the progress of the order and subsequently monitor the delivery. This concludes the process.
