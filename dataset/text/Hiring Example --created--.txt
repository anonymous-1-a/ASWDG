If there is a hiring need, the process starts. First, the hiring manager of the firm should develop a hiring proposal, and then the senior manager should review it. If the proposal is not approved, no new hires are allowed. Otherwise, the hiring manager should develop the position description, and then the senior manager should review it until she or he approves it. When the senior manager agrees, the HR specialist creates the open position.
