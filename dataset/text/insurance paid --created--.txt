The process involves a customer who has a disability. When the disability occurs, the customer is required to submit a disability claim. The JOC of the insurance company receives a disability claim. Then, they enter the claim details into the claims DB and do a basic claims check based on the customer DB later. If the claim is denied, a denial notice is sent to the customer, and the entire claim process is completed. If the base check passes, the insurer's SCO will do an in-depth assessment of the claim, mainly through a risk profile DB. They then estimate the monthly allowance, and if only short-term support is required, the SCO registers the information into the claim database. The claim process is closed after registration. If long-term funding is needed, the SCO needs to request a medical report from the provider. When the doctor's examination report sent by the medical service provider is received by the SCO, the SCO will register the information in the claim DB. If the customer is fraudulent, the SCO rejects the claim and sends a rejection notice to the customer, and the process ends. If not, the finance officer will trigger the first authorized payment and then notify the customer that the payment is pending. The process ends.
